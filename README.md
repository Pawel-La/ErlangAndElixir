# Erlang And Elixir
Basics of Erlang and in near future also elixir:
Erlang:  
-> lab1 - ONP calculator  
-> lab2 - quicksort and some others simple functions  
-> lab3 - pingpong - basic program showing receive and send usage with Erlang processes  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - distances - time comparision of programs running with and without multiprocessing  
-> lab4 - first look at gen-server  
-> project - project of stations collecting data of air condition,  
with values like date, station_name, coordinates etc. Project is being developed throughout the whole course.   
  
Elixir:
